# Array Manipulation Techniques in Python

## Overview

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks exploring various array manipulation techniques using Python and Numpy. These notebooks cover essential array operations that are fundamental in data analysis and scientific computing. The topics range from creating and manipulating arrays to advanced techniques like slicing, fancy indexing, reshaping, and combining arrays. The goal is to develop a strong foundation in Numpy's capabilities, which are crucial for efficient data handling in data science and machine learning projects.
## Key Features

* Array creation and random array generation.
* Array slicing and fancy indexing.
* Array iteration.
* Changing array shapes using reshape, ravel, and expand.
* Transposing arrays.
* Joining arrays with concatenate, stack, column_stack, hstack, and vstack.
* Splitting arrays using split, hsplit, and vsplit.
## Technology Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: NumPy
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Notebooks

* Array_Shape_Transformations.ipynb: Introduction to fundamental array manipulation techniques.
